# Project Structure Reorganization - October 22, 2025

## What Changed

The `quotations` Django app was moved from the root directory into the `backend/` folder for better organization and Django convention alignment.

## Before (Old Structure)

```
vendor-quotation-system/
├── backend/backend/         ← Django settings
├── quotations/             ← App at root (confusing!)
├── frontend/
└── manage.py
```

## After (New Structure) ✅

```
vendor-quotation-system/
├── backend/
│   ├── quotations/         ← Moved inside backend (clear!)
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── frontend/
└── manage.py
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/settings.py**
   - Changed: `'quotations'` → `'backend.quotations'` in `INSTALLED_APPS`

2. **backend/urls.py**
   - Changed: `include('quotations.urls')` → `include('backend.quotations.urls')`

3. **backend/quotations/apps.py**
   - Changed: `name = 'quotations'` → `name = 'backend.quotations'`
   - Changed: `import quotations.signals` → `import backend.quotations.signals`
