# Overview

This is a multi-industry vendor quotation comparison platform designed to help manufacturing companies compare vendor quotes and select optimal suppliers based on cost, quality, delivery, and other factors. The initial client is a plastic manufacturing company, but the architecture supports expansion to any industry (steel, chemicals, food, etc.).

The application provides vendor management, product cataloging, quotation entry, and automated comparison with scoring/ranking capabilities. It uses a full-stack architecture with Angular frontend, Django REST Framework backend, and SQLite database (for development - easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL for production).

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: Angular 20+ with standalone components and Angular Material Design
- **Component Structure**: Enterprise-level modular architecture with standalone components
- **UI Framework**: Angular Material (indigo-pink theme) for professional enterprise UI
- **Charts**: ng2-charts with Chart.js for data visualization (bar charts, doughnut charts)
- **State Management**: Service-based architecture with RxJS observables
- **Routing**: Angular Router with shell layout and child routes for all modules
- **HTTP Communication**: HttpClient with proxy configuration to backend API

**Enterprise UI Architecture**:
- **Shell Layout**: Professional sidebar navigation (VendorCompare Enterprise Edition) with persistent menu and top toolbar
- **Dashboard Module**: KPI cards (companies, vendors, products, quotations count) + interactive charts (recent activity bar chart, vendor distribution pie chart)
- **CRUD Modules**: Complete Material Design tables and dialog forms for Companies, Vendors, Products, and Quotations
- **Compare Module**: Enhanced vendor comparison with Material cards, ranking badges, color-coded lead times, and result highlighting
- **Responsive Design**: Material sidenav/toolbar system for desktop and mobile compatibility

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Standalone components for better tree-shaking and reduced bundle size
- Proxy configuration (`proxy.conf.json`) routes `/api` requests to Django backend on port 8000
- Separation of concerns with dedicated `ApiService` for all HTTP/CRUD operations
- Dialog-based forms (MatDialog) for add/edit operations to maintain clean UX
- Color-coded visual indicators (rating badges, lead time chips, rank highlighting)

## Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: Django 5.2+ with Django REST Framework
- **API Design**: RESTful API using ViewSets and DefaultRouter
- **Data Layer**: Django ORM with model-based database schema
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication (extendable for JWT/OAuth)
- **CORS Handling**: `django-cors-headers` middleware for cross-origin requests

**Key Design Decisions**:
- ViewSet-based architecture for CRUD operations on all entities (Company, Vendor, Product, Quotation)
- Multi-tenancy support through Company model - each company has isolated vendors, products, and quotations
- Filtering capabilities through query parameters (e.g., `?company_id=1` to filter by company)
- Dedicated comparison endpoint (`/api/compare/`) for vendor analysis

**Data Models**:
1. **Company**: Root entity for multi-tenancy (name, industry_type, address, contact_email)
2. **Vendor**: Supplier information linked to company (name, city, state, rating, contact)
3. **Product**: Material/product catalog (name, category, grade_spec, unit_type, pricing)
4. **Quotation**: Vendor quotes for products (product_price, delivery_price, lead_time, kilo_price)
5. **OrderRequest**: Purchase order requests (product, quantity, location, required_date)
6. **ComparisonResult**: Analysis results (vendor ranking, costs, scores)

**Business Logic**:
- Vendor comparison algorithm evaluates total cost per unit, delivery pricing, quality grades, and lead times
- **Smart Delivery Location**: Automatically applies 20% interstate shipping surcharge when vendor state differs from delivery location
  - Local vendors (same state as delivery) = base delivery price
  - Interstate vendors (different state) = base delivery price + 20% surcharge
- Scoring system ranks vendors based on multiple weighted factors (lower score = better)
- Results stored in ComparisonResult model for historical tracking

- Angular dev server on port 5000 serves the UI
- RESTful endpoints with consistent URL structure
- Query parameter filtering for related data

## Recent Changes (October 16, 2025)

**‚úÖ LATEST UPDATE - Enhanced Comparison Results Table:**

**Vendor Comparison Table Enhancement (Client-Friendly Format)**:
- **Column Headers (8 columns in this order)**:
  1. **Vendor Name** - Company name with üèÜ Best badge for top-ranked vendor
  2. **Place** - City, State with Interstate/Local indicator
  3. **Product Price (‚Çπ/kg)** - Base product price per kilogram
  4. **Delivery Charges (‚Çπ)** - Total delivery cost (shows 20% surcharge for interstate)
  5. **Landing Price (‚Çπ/kg)** - Final cost per kg (Product Price + Delivery Charges √∑ Quantity) - Highlighted in blue
  6. **Kilo Price (‚Çπ/kg)** - Original quoted kilo price from vendor
  7. **Grade** - Product quality specification
  8. **Lead Time** - Delivery days with color-coded chips (Green ‚â§4 days, Orange 5-6 days, Red ‚â•7 days)

- **Enhanced Table Headers**: Dark blue background (#3f51b5), white bold text, extra padding for visibility
- **Best vendor highlighting**: Green background row with üèÜ trophy badge
- **Interstate shipping**: Red "Interstate" tag with surcharge note
- **Local shipping**: Green "Local" tag
- **Landing Price prominence**: Blue color (#3f51b5) with larger font size
- All pricing components clearly separated for easy client understanding

**Quotation Form Enhancement (Landing Price Calculation)**:
- Renamed "Delivery Price" to "Delivery Charges" throughout the UI
- Added "Quantity (kg)" field to quotation form (default: 100 kg)
- Added auto-calculated "Landing Price (‚Çπ/kg)" field with formula: `Landing Price = Product Price + (Delivery Charges / Quantity)`
- Real-time calculation updates as user enters product price, quantity, or delivery charges
- Landing Price field is read-only with helpful hint text
- Robust validation using `Number.isFinite()` to prevent NaN display and handle zero values correctly
- Landing price stored in `kilo_price` database field for historical tracking
- Quotations table updated to display "Delivery Charges" and "Landing Price (‚Çπ/kg)" columns

**‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **Database Migration (SQLite)**: 
   - Migrated from disabled Neon PostgreSQL endpoint to SQLite for development
   - Environment-aware configuration: uses PostgreSQL when DATABASE_URL is available, falls back to SQLite otherwise
   - All migrations successfully applied, seed data populated
   - All API endpoints verified working (companies, vendors, products, quotations, user-profiles)

2. **UI Icon Fix**:
   - Added Material Icons font CDN link to index.html
   - Replaced mat-nav-list with custom flexbox navigation for proper icon/text layout
   - Icons now display correctly without overlapping text
   - Professional enterprise UI appearance maintained

3. **UserProfile Auto-Creation**:
   - Added Django signals to automatically create UserProfile when User is created
   - Ensures relational integrity for user management module
   - Prevents null-profile errors

4. **Security Improvements**:
   - Moved SECRET_KEY to environment variable with development fallback
   - Made DEBUG setting environment-driven (production-safe)

**Database Status**: Using SQLite (db.sqlite3) with 1 company, 3 vendors, 2 products, 5 quotations, 3 user profiles
